It will help you locate all the required utilities/libraries        and detail which versions have been tested to work.  This version will provide        a checklist view.        <p>        Install the packages to whatever directories you like, but record their locations.        We recommend a directory location that will be used in example paths.        You will use these locations later to setup your CLASSPATH and PATH environment        variables.  If a package is mentioned as residing in the lib directory then we        suggest you use that version.  Some of these are hard to find, tracking at a        different version or we have modified them.        </p>        <a name="Libs"></a>        <ol>            <li>                <b><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a></b> is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is the easiest to use for Xj3D development.                There are many other IDEs out there, i.e. IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc., but we prefer NetBeans.                To check out the latest JDK + NetBeans bundle, search online for <code>Java SE bundle of NetBeans IDE</code>.                This bundle will give you the latest JDK, Apache Ant and an IDE that includes all tools to checkout, build and run the code                all within the IDE.                <p>                <b>Checking out the Code:</b>                <ul>                    <li>Read the online tutorials for NetBeans SVN checkouts.</li>                    <li>https://svn.code.sf.net/p/xj3d/code/branches/NPS</li>                </ul>            </li>            <li>                <p>                <b>JavaCC</b> - version 5.0 is included in the checked out codebase.            </li>            <li>                <b>JInput</b> - Java Input library for USB devices<p>                <font color="red">The 2.0 codebase has not been updated to support the latest Jinput.

The easiest way to setup the system environment variables is to        modify the .bashrc file located in <code>$userid</code>.        Where <code>$userid</code> is your profile space, i.e. /Users/your-name-here.  For        Windows machines, modify Environment Variables from the Control Panel's        advanced settings.  PATH settings are only required if you wish to run        the code from the command line.  JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME will be required        in the PATH setting for the /bin directories for each.        </p>        <p>CLASSPATH is already setup to be used in NetBeans, or on the command line via the Apache Ant <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> located in the base directory of the project.        <hr width="100%" />        <br/>        <a name="Build"><H3>Building the Xj3D source</H3></a>        Use the NetBeans IDE to compile/build/run Xj3D and examples, or        <p>        from the command line, navigate to the project folder/directory and type:        <pre>ant compile</pre>        <p>        This will build all of the parser source code using javacc as well as        all the java source code for the browser and all applications.        <p>        If you wish to run example code type:        <pre>ant compile.all.examples</pre>        Typing just        <pre>ant -p</pre>        will provide a complete list of options available, including those for        compiling a code for only a specific renderer.        <p>        To test that you have the codebase compiling correctly try the following:        <pre>ant run</pre>        hit the Go! button,        see box, rejoice!        <p>Command line scripts are also copied down to the base directory for convenience for running Xj3D and the converter.</p>        <hr width="100%" />        <h3>More info on Xj3D?</h3>        <p>Head <a href="indexXj3D.nps.redirect.html">here</a>.</p>        <p>            Last Revised: <i>$Date: 2014-10-24 14:45:57 +0800 (äº”, 2014-10-24) $</i>        </p>    </body></html>
