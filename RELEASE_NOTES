  ***** ISSUES:

  Scene /www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/UniversalMediaMaterials/ArtDecoExamples.x3d
  renders in monochrome.  Issue with displaying material nodes loaded from
  ExternProtoDeclare ProtoInstance nodes.

  When initially opening an *.x3d file that has inline urls pointing to *.wrl
  files, Xj3D balks and gives warnings that it can't resolve URLs pointing to
  *.wrl files even if on the same relative path as the parent *.x3d file.

  When resolving the mime type of a *.js file loaded from a Script Node url
  field of a VRML97 (.wrl) scene, it is resolved as an application/ecmascript
  mime type and therefore no scriptloader will be instantiated since the only
  accepted mime type for *.wrl is application/javascript.

  Complex X3D scenes are not being exported correctly to VRML97 format.  Example
  file is the ConformanceNist/Appearance/FontStyle/driver.x3d -> .wrl

  When exporting Script node urls to classic VRML, relative paths are not being
  honored.  Full paths are being written.

  NavInfo for the center of rotation not right for ViewPoint node.  Scene jumps
  to default of zero in the "Y" axis

  Added note in DefaultRigidBodyPhysicsManager about about ODE not
  re-initializing during a rebuild of an Xj3DBrowser instance in the same JVM
  session.  This is due to initializing an ODE lib in a static initializer of
  the DRBPM and not in an instance constructor.

  ****** FIXES / UPGRADES:

  ${java.home}/lib/content-types.properties was removed in JDK9+. It is now 
  included internally in the binary java.base module. Workaround implemented in 
  org.web3d.net.protocol.FileResourceConnection

  BaseRigidBodyCollection was improperly throwing an exception for a value of < 0
  for the vfMaxCorrectionSpeed field. A value of -1 is the spec default value. 

  Upgrade to Jogamp v2.4. JVMs > v8 will throw a SIGABRT due to Apple enforcing 
  invalidating drag regions only on the main thread.
 
  http://forum.jogamp.org/How-to-enable-Gluegen-Java3D-on-Java-9-td4038338.html

  Dr. S. Kwon, visiting postdoc from S. Korea fixed Extrusion handling (a long 
  time lingering issue).

  Made threads in ContentLoader and FramerateThrottle daemon so as not to keep
  the JVM alive when the browser window is closed, esp. when launched from
  another application.

  Upgrade JogAmp (JOGL, JOAL, GlueGen) to v2.3.2

  Fixed issue with the SwingConsoleWindow where the caret would not auto scroll
  to the bottom of the text field area.

  Refactored Aviatrix3D to remove requirement for calling
  GraphicsOutputDevice.initContext outside of Aviatrix3D.  Renamed to
  createGLContext which is called the first time draw, or setDrawableObjects is
  called from the rendering loop.  This restores how Aviatrix3D used to work
  before JOGL 2+ was introduced.  Also, now properly disposing of JOGL resources
  during shutdown.  Resource shutdown order is sensitive to prevent JVM crashes.

  Fixed issue in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.text.BaseFontStyle where
  the incorrect defaults were set.  We now set "BEGIN" "FIRST" for the major and
  minor justification values.

  A negative MovieTexture speed is legal via the spec., therefore, don't throw
  an InvalidFieldException, but just warn that reverse speed is not yet
  implemented in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.texture.BaseMoveTexture

  Added Alan Hudson's initial cut at a 3mf filter converter.  Added a DeathTimer
  to the ThumbnailImager as image capture hangs on corrupt scenes.

  Fixed HAnimObject type array casting error in
  org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.hanim.BaseHAnimHumanoid line 663.  Fix
  AIOOB Exception in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.GeometryUtils in
  rebuildFaceLists line 1216

  Field 'axisRotation', an SFRotation type, now recognized for nodes
  CylinderSensor and PlaneSensor, however, the value of the float array is
  currently not being translated to the geometry's local coordinate system

  Fixed potential AIOOB exception in
  org.web3d.vrml.renderer.ogl.nodes.geom3d.OGLElevationGrid

  Now using exclusive J3D's HashSet and IntHashMap.  Fixed all generic compile
  warnings and suppressing those that are known about.  Removed some
  org.web3d.util classes that were not used.

  Upgrades to J3D and Aviatrix3D version 3.0.0.  Merge complete as of 01 AUG 15
  to the GitHub versions maintained by Justin Couch.  Removed Xj3D ErrorReporter
  and relying on J3D's version.  Refactored to remove redundant casts, enforce
  auto-boxing, @Override annotations and other JDK 1.7 source refactorings.
  Fixed potential AIOOB Exceptions in
  org.web3d.vrml.scripting.external.sai.SFImageWrapper  Fix NPE in
  org.web3d.vrml.scripting.browser.SceneUpdateTraverser when clearing a scene.
  Fixed potential AIOOB Exceptions in org.web3d.vrml.nodes.proto.PrototypeDecl,
  org.web3d.vrml.scripting.external.sai.MFImageWrapper and
  org.web3d.util.SFImageUtils.  Tests in parsetest/sai/external revealed these
  errors.

  Implemented missing MetadataBoolean node for the 3.3+ profile

  Fixed issue: ImageTexture Material lighting model is overriding Material USE
  elsewhere in a scene.  This fix was made in
  org.web3d.vrml.renderer.ogl.nodes.shape.OGLAppearance in the
  setIgnoreDiffuse(NIOBufferImage image) method.  Researching the Spec.
  http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.2/Part01/components/texturing.html#ImageTexture
  did not reveal a clear cut case for ignoring diffuse color when an image is
  not considered grey-scale.  Turns out that transparency, or the (1 - alpha)
  value of the image, is the correct indicator of ignoring a material node's
  diffuse color component.  Added a "hasTransparency" field to
  org.web3d.image.NIOBufferImage which is set based on the type of image used
  in an ImageTexture node.

  Remove fastinfoset_1.2.9.jar as the fastinfoset was internally adopted into
  the JDK sometime ago.  Now using the internal version, but now need to set
  the javac flag of -XDignore.symbol.file so that internal packages of the JDK
  will be recognized at compile time.

  Update JOAL, JOGL and GlueGen to v2.3.1.  Everything that used to be packaged
  as javax.media.opengl is now -> com.jogamp.opengl

  Partial fix to long standing issue with
  org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.geom.Text2D not handling Appearance FontStyle
  justify for both horizontal (major) and vertical (minor) attributes.  The
  issue being that JUSTIFY_END for the major was not correct and JUSTIFY_BEGIN,
  FIRST & MIDDLE for the minor was not correct (defaulted to END no matter the
  setting).  Horizontal TRUE works pretty close now, but with some hacks.
  Horizontal FALSE is not quite so good, but better than it was.  Basically, the
  bounding box for the character data was not being employed correctly to the
  GLContext for character translation and still needs some tweaking to meet the
  spec.

  Finally, fix for ConformanceNist/Appearance/FontStyle/driver.x3d and driver.js
  (createX3DFromString).  Quite a few things were missing for who knows how
  long, but 2 items in particular:

  1) SFBool field values from script nodes were resolving to lowercase causing
     the X3DRelaxedParser to choke
  2) ROUTES to transform nodes (in script land) were being sent with children
     nodes that had valid, but old parents causing Aviatrix3D to throw and
     AlreadyParentedException.  This is now fixed to remove the old parent so
     that the ROUTE to a DEFd Transform can reparent the children

  Fixed NPE in org.j3d.aviatrix3d.TransformGroup line 339

  Upgraded to JavaCC v6.0.1 and Rhino 1_7R4.  Ant target jjdoc now produces
  BNF documentation for the VRML and X3D Parsers

  Fixed issue where exporting to classic VRML did not literally retain escaped
  double quotations in META values

  Now reporting exporter information in exported classic VRML files

  Improved dynamic headless screen capture by including viewpoint definitions in
  the name of the screen capture image file.  Output better usage messages for
  the Replica app.  Implemented the DeathTimer to counter the
  BlockingWorldLoader in case a scene load function crashes the JVM before
  screen capture occurs, or if there were an issue during screen capture.

  Fixed two NPEs in Aviatrix3D.  Line 207 of org.j3d.aviatrix3d.BaseGroup and
  line 187 of org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.nodes.LODGroup.  Why these showed up
  now is uncertain.  They were revealed by the X3D scene:
  file:/www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Savage/AuvWorkbench/OperatingAreas/MultipleUnmannedVehiclesOffMonterey.x3d

  Aviatrix3D semi-resolution to thrown GLException: If we encounter a
  GLException when attempting to make the GLContext current on the thread, then
  just terminate and report one exception instead of reporting repeatedly

  Fixed a NPE issue in OGLAppearance where threads were in competition for image
  processing arrays

  Fixed NPE issue in SwingLocationToolbar when hitting the reload button w/o a
  valid file url in the location bar.  This occurs when a file is loaded via a
  FileStream and the browser only has directory info on the loaded scenegraph.

  Fixed issue with the GLJPanel (-swing-lightweight) not gaining the window
  focus if launched from the Xj3DBrowser app.

  Fixed Aviatrix3D NPEs occurring in the BaseSurface when reinitializing the
  GLContext after an AA adjustment

  Ran into a situation on Mac OS X running VMWare for Windows 7 and
  a GLException was thrown for glBlendEquation not supported.  Had to fix this
  in org.j3d.aviatrix3d.BlendAttributes in the render() method

  Fixed a threading issue in Replica that prevent consistent screenshot captures
  via headless rendering when run through a continuous loop against a directory
  of X3D scenes to capture all coded viewpoints

  Fixed NPE in org.j3d.aviatrix3d.Shape3D getCenter().  Field bounds
  was sometimes not initialized.

  Upgraded JOGL to v2.2.4


Release: 2.1(May 22, 2014)
-------------------------
Major changes since 2.0-RC1:

  Due to many improvements and bug fixes during this reporting cycle, NPS
  MOVES feels v2.1 is warranted over 2.0 since it has been almost 4 years since
  a release was offered.

  Upgraded Aviatrix3D to JOGL v2.1.  This is a major update to Aviatrix3D in
  which we are now leveraging JOGL's Native Windowing Tookkit (NEWT) to render
  the 3D pipeline which has the advantage of offering a way to decouple from the
  AWT/Swing EDT model.  This capability paves the way towards much more
  efficient multi-threaded rendering. Simple explanation here:
  https://sites.google.com/site/justinscsstuff/jogl-tutorial-2.  Xj3D defaults
  to NEWT unless specified to use one of the swing-lightweight (GLJPanel), or
  swing (GLCanvas) modes..

  Jogamp has also implemented Automated Native Library Loading:
  http://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/userguide/#automatednativelibraryloading

  Implemented the Arc2D on the OGL and NR render packages.  Still
  need to implement the SAI node

  Fixed issue in the CadFilter for the DefaultRigidBodyPhysicsManager which
  must be initialized by the CadFilter startup process, else an
  UnsatisfiedLinkError was thrown

  BrowserConfig defaults are now set to highest levels for (AA, AAQ, TQ, and PQ)

  Fixed bug in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.BaseGroupingNode when an
  incorrect type VRMLGroupNodeType vice VRMLBoundedNodeType was used to render
  a .wrl type proto example

  Addressed fix for NPE when employing the replica (headless) screen capture app
  for capturing screen shots of scripted scenes ensuring building the script
  engines a Replica app startup.

  Fixed issue where hardcoded values were passed for anti-aliasing vice letting
  JOGL tell us what the maximum number of available FSAA samples are via its
  GLCapabilities improvements

  Incorporated Vince Marchetti's contributions who improved the jgeom lib for
  mesh and NURBS operations.

  Corrected issue in org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.input.dis.DISConnectionHandler
  where the BehaviorProducerUDP thread in OpenDIS was not daemon which prevented
  the JVM from shutting down.

  Bugfix 615

  Fixed a usability issue with old inlined viewpoints not being removed when a
  new inline is dynamically inserted. XMSF Bugs 439 and 1317 pertain.  The fix was
  implemented in:
  http://svn.xj3d.org/xj3d_code/branches/NPS/org/xj3d/impl/core/eventmodel/DefaultFrameStateManager.java

  Bugfixes 300, 506, 601, 615, 640

  Bugfixes for XMSF bugs 439 and 1317

  Aviatrix3D bugfix for IllegalStateException when calling setLive(state)

  Bugfixes 609 and 610 for Aviatrix3D

  Can now package installers via iZpack scheme for all 64 bit Win, Linux and
  Mac OS X systems

  Updated convenience scripts located in /bin to invoke Xj3D via Apache Ant

  Implemented a self updating Version class which shows Xj3D and component
  information in the browser's console window

  All third party support libs and all required natives for 64 bit Win, Linux
  and Mac OS X systems included for ease of building and running Xj3D

  Upgraded to Open DIS v4.08 developed by NPS MOVES
