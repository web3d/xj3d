<p>Allows the user to "fly" around the scene. Viewer motion is not 
constrained by horizontal geometry. Left and right cursor motion rotates 
the viewer left or right. Cursor up motion causes the viewer to move
forward. Cursor down motion causes the viewer to move backwards.</p>

<p>The mouse button must be down for this effect to work.</p>
