Procedures for conducting a merge of the Trunk to the NPS Branch

1) First, sign up for commit notification by email.  See Mail Notifications at:
http://www.xj3d.org/svn.html for the sign up procedure.  Make a folder to direct
these commit emails via your email client filtering process.  Highly suggest
categorizing these folders to src/java, apps/browser/src/java,
apps/cadfilter/src/java, etc., so that you can track specific changes.  Only
perform a merge for those specific things that have changed in the trunk.  Don't
perform a merge on the whole repository (can produce many unnecessary conflicts).

2) From NetBeans, right click over folder to conduct merge, i.e. src/java.
Select -> Subversion -> Merge Changes...  See PNG titled NetBeans-SVN-Merge to
see settings (must choose a Starting Revision to merge from, preferably a date
before the last trunk revision date to ensure you capture all updates).  Once
the list of revisions appear after the search, select the revision, then select
"include this revision" to ensure all merges will be captured.  Keep Ending
Revision blank (this is the HEAD).  Make sure that you select: Merge From
One Repository Folder.  Could be disastrous if the default from origin is
selected.  You should see an active svn update happen only to those files that
were announced as updated in the svn commit emails.  Be sure to annotate the
merge date below with current date on top.

    a) Carefully update the project tree by directory to lessen collision impact,
       i.e. one directory at a time.  Save src/java for last
    b) Be careful to watch for lib/ additions/deletions in the source commit emails
    c) !! Very important !! Look for any modifications to the file
       src/java/Makefile-opengl.   This contains the build order list.  Make sure
       that the build.properties property "xj3d.build.order" matches the
       Makefile-opengl package build order exactly.  There are source commits
       that are just placeholders, legacy or experimental sources and are not to
       be compiled.  The build order says what to include.  The makefile uses
       dot notation.  You'll have to modify to path notation in the properties file.
       The apps build order lists will also have to be checked:
       apps/browser/src/java/Makefile and apps/cadfilter/src/java/Makefile.
       The corresponding "browser.build.order" and "cadfilter.build.order" properties
       in build.properties should reflect those specific Makefile build orders.
    d) Since the trunk is now building with Ant, keep an eye on the build
       includes/excludes listed in the compile target

3) Painstakingly resolve each tree and file conflict after the Merge Complete
message shows what needs to be done.  Copy this output to a *.txt file so that
you can reference it often.  Conflict resolution is done by navigating to the
directory/file, right clicking -> Subversion -> Resolve Conflicts... and either
Accept, or Accept & Next on the remote file tab (not the working copy, unless
you want to specifically keep experimental changes -- this will take some real
dedicated work to resolve successfully).

4) To see a diff of a branch source package against the trunk, navigate to the
specific branch source package and type:

# This should ignore whitespace diffs, but give contextual differences
svn diff --diff-cmd diff -x "-wu" --old . --new  http://svn.xj3d.org/xj3d_code/trunk/src/java/{src-package} > difflog

A file named difflog will be created in the package where the above command is
invoked which can be checked for variations between the branch and trunk

5) If there happens to be a tree conflict, open a CLI and type:
    svn resolve --accept working -R .

6) A handy way to retrieve a previously deleted file (you must have researched
the revision # where it was deleted):
svn cp http://svn.xj3d.org/xj3d_code/branches/NPS/lib/aviatrix3d-all_2.1.0.jar@10329 aviatrix3d-all_2.1.0.jar

Dates of last merge with the trunk (http://svn.xj3d.org/xj3d_code/trunk)

16 JUL 2013 Change ColladaParser to use MatrixTransform to handle full matrices
            better in Sketchup files, Added a FlattenTextureTransform filter for
            baking down TextureTransform capabilities into the TextureCoordinate
            node, Added NR support and filter chain support for TextureProperties
21 JUN 2013 Update to j3d-org-all_2.0.0.jar, Lots of cadfilter improvements, esp.
            for importing Collada format, better error reporting; and Replica
            snapshot improvements.  Reconfirm working unit tests work.
02 APR 2013 Used the javac -Xlint:all flag to expose all further warnings
28 MAR 2013 Major commit to align with the past 2.5 weeks of cleaning up the
            trunk by typing collections, correcting javadoc, reformatting source
            to be more readable, removing unused imports, adding @Override
            annotations, unhiding variables that were mistakenly hidden and
            other minor edits to quell generated warnings.  There remains work
            in typing collections as there are a lot of collection arrays that
            can not be typed (generic array creation warning), and other issues
            where home rolled Maps and Sets are used vice the platform version
            which return Objects vice a Type.
01 MAR 2013 Various updates/fixes to the cadfilter app
06 SEP 2012 Update the Make file build system to keep legacy building up to date
26 AUG 2012 Confirmed both NPS Branch and Trunk spec examples, parsetest and
            SAI/EAI examples are identical, updated and most are now functioning
            after being dormant for some time
25 AUG 2012 Confirmed both NPS Branch and Trunk are now identical codebases via
            svn command for diff given in #4 expect for two minor deviations.
            NPS Branch has an org.web3d.util.Version file that is updated via
            an Ant regex parse during a clean/build.  Also,
            web3d.vrml.renderer.ogl.nodes.geom3d.OGLExtrusion has extra sys outs
            for debugging current extrusion issues.
25 AUG 2012 Lots of typing collections, removing redundant casts, correcting javadoc,
            removing unused imports, adding @Override annotations.  Fixed bug in
            org.web3d.vrml.renderer.common.nodes.BaseGroupingNode where
            VRMLGroupNodeType was left inadvertently when VRMLBoundedNodeType
            was meant for setShared.  Get a lot of the EAI and SAI parsetest
            code working for regression testing.
21 AUG 2012 Clean up for working with the Replica app
20 AUG 2012 Clean up a lot of generics, removed redundant casts, StringBuilder ->
