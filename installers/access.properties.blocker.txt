access.properties is maintained by local users only.

access.properties is blocked from uploading into subversion
(by setting the svn:ignore property on the parent directory).

Users can create their own private access.properties file if needed.
Copy the access.properties.template as new file access.properties
and then edit the CHANGEME values to get the correct format.
